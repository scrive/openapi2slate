    # Overview

    The Scrive Document API uses HTTPS methods and RESTful endpoints to create,
    edit, and manage the life-cycle of documents in the Scrive eSign system.
    JSON is the data interchange format, but we also use query parameters.

    The API is accessed through a versioned URL.
    This allows users to clearly identify which API they are using, and to make
    it easier to upgrade to any newer versions.
    It also avoids having to use version codes in HTTP headers.

    Any breaking changes to the API will be introduced through a new version
    number.
    We aim to keep these changes to a minimum, and when we do so, will support
    the current API until it is phased out.

    <aside class="success">
    This document is for Version 2 of the Scrive Document API, which is the
    latest version of our Document API.
    </aside>

    <aside class="notice">
    Non-breaking changes may be introduced without changing version.
    These may include additional fields to JSON data structures, optional
    parameters to API calls, new features that can be exposed through existing
    API calls, or new API calls.
    </aside>

    <aside class="notice">
    Always use UTF-8 encoding.
    This is the only officially supported encoding for our API.
    </aside>

    ## Environments & IP Addresses

    This section provides details on the IP addresses used by the Scrive Service. You may want to whitelist
    these addresses in your firewalls for outgoing traffic but more importantly for incoming traffic from
    Scrive eSign when using callbacks.

    <aside class="warning">
    Do not call the API using these IP addresses directly! Server Name Identification (SNI) is used to
    route calls to different services on the same IP address and thus hostnames must be used to reliably reach
    the service you intend to integrate with.
    </aside>


    ### Production
    The main application is available through the `scrive.com` domain.

    <aside class="notice">
    This is the live production environment, for testing, please use API Testbed.
    </aside>

    The IP addresses that may be used as endpoints to and from our system are:

    * 46.51.201.244
    * 52.208.49.53
    * 54.229.202.191
    * 54.246.132.30
    * 54.72.249.47
    * 54.72.251.235
    * 34.251.5.243
    * 52.208.131.2
    * 99.80.133.235

    ### API Testbed

    A testing environment is available through the `api-testbed.scrive.com`
    domain.

    This environment should be used when developing an integration with the
    Scrive eSign system.

    <aside class="warning">
    This is not to be used with any critical information.
    We make no guarantees as to the availability of the server, or the data
    stored by it.
    </aside>

    We usually deploy the latest production environment to our API testbed, but
    may occasionally update it with newer builds, which may not be as reliable
    or well tested.

    The API testbed uses `54.229.20.170` as its IP address.

    ## API Explorer
    An interactive API Explorer is available for both environments:

    * [API Testbed](https://api-testbed.scrive.com/api-explorer)
    * [Production](https://scrive.com/api-explorer)

    This is useful way to test API calls and the OAuth workflow.

    The implementation is in JavaScript and you can use
    [Firebug](https://getfirebug.com/) or the
    [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) to inspect
    HTTP requests.

    ## Upgrading from Version 1
    There is no change to the Document workflow from Version 1 of the API.
    The main changes in this version, compared to Version 1, are:

    * A new naming structure for API endpoints
    * Changes to the JSON data structures
    * Changes to parameters and their names
    * More comprehensive documentation
    * Better error messages

    The root endpoint for Version 1 was `/api/v1`, this has changed to
    `/api/v2/documents`.

    Most of the parameters have had minor name changes to make it easier for
    newcomers to use.
    However, the parameters for the `/list` call have undergone significant
    structural changes.

    <aside class="notice">
    The most important things to watch for when upgrading from Version 1, apart
    from those listed above:
    </aside>

    * The Document JSON structure has changed, and fields have been renamed
    * The list call returns the full Document JSON for all documents, make sure
      you include `gzip` in your `Accept-Encoding` header to avoid large
      response sizes.

    The following table summarises the changes in naming of the API calls.
    For details of the new parameters and JSON data structures, please consult
    the documentation.

    | API endpoint in Version 1 (`/api/v1`)                        | Equivalent API endpoint in Version 2 (`/api/v2/documents`)  |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

    # Quick Start
    To get started using our API it is recommended to first read the
    [Introduction](#introduction), this will give you an overview of some key
    concepts in use by the Scrive eSign system.

    Once you are familiar with the basic concepts the simplest document workflow
    can be achieved by:

    1. Creating a new document using `api/v2/documents/new`
       (see [New Document](#new-document))
    2. Updating the document with the desired process options and signatory
       details using `api/v2/documents/{document_id}/update`
       (see [Update a document](#update-a-document))
    3. Start the signing process with `api/v2/documents/{document_id}/start`
       (see [Start the signing process](#start-the-signing-process))

    # Introduction
    Scrive eSign is a system for signing documents electronically.

    Users need to create an account with Scrive to create and send Documents,
    but recipients do not need to have an account.

    Documents in the Scrive eSign system define the parties to the document,
    including the information these parties parties should fill out, the
    document workflow, such as delivery and authentication for the parties, and
    many other features related to the E-signing of documents as provided by
    Scrive.

    The Scrive Document API uses the Document JSON data structure to represent
    Documents in the Scrive eSign system.
    These always include an array of `parties`, which are either signing or
    non-signing parties to the document, and represent the workflow assigned to
    that party, and their individual information.
    These use the Signatory JSON data structure.

    We will first talk about the Document JSON, followed by the Signatory JSON.
    For the reference documentation about these data structures please see the
    [Definitions](#definitions).

    ## Documents
    A core data structure used throughout the API is the Document JSON.
    The Document JSON is used to create documents, define the workflow for
    signing and non-signing parties, monitor the progress of the document, etc.

    A key property of a document is its `status` (as defined by
    [DocumentStatus](#document-status)).

    Newly created documents have `status: "preparation"` and can be easily
    modified.
    Most changes to the Document at this stage are done using the Document
    `update` API call, by passing a Document JSON with values updated as
    necessary.
    Not all fields can be updated in this way.
    For example, the Document’s `id` is auto-generated and cannot be changed.
    For details of which fields cannot be updated in this way, look for the
    `readOnly` property in the Document [Definitions](#definitions).

    Once the document signing process has been started, using the `start` API
    call, the `status` will change to `"pending"` and relatively few
    modifications by the author are possible.
    Making the `start` API call will also deliver the document to the parties,
    depending on the delivery methods set (e.g. by email or SMS).

    After all signing parties have successfully signed the document, its status
    will change to `"closed"`, after which it cannot be modified.

    A pending document can also be cancelled by the author using the `cancel`
    API call, or rejected by a signing party, resulting in its status being
    `"cancelled"` or `"rejected"`, respectively.

    Any actions performed by parties to a document, such as signing, can only
    be performed in the web application interface.
    We will not provide an API for such actions.

    Please refer to `Document` in the [Definitions](#definitions) for a
    detailed description of all the fields available, and their use.

    ## Templates
    It is possible to set up template documents to be used with the "new
    document from template" API call.

    Any document in preparation can be made into a template by executing an
    update call and setting the `"template"` field to be `true`. This cannot be
    reversed once set, and templates cannot direclty be made into documents for
    signing.

    Templates have the same JSON structure as regular documents and can also be
    updated.
    In particular, their `"id"` can be used to
    [create a new document from a template](#new-document-from-template).
    Updating a template will only affect documents created from a template
    *after* the template was updated.

    Finally, using the list call, it is possible to list all your available
    templates by setting the appropriate filters.

    ## Parties
    Every Document has an array field named `parties`.
    This defines the signing and viewing parties to a document, their details,
    how the document is to be delivered to them, an extra authentication that
    must be performed, etc.

    It is possible to add an extra party to a Document in preparation using the
    `update` call.
    Simply add an extra empty object (*i.e.* `{ }`) to the list of existing
    parties and the Scrive API will return an additional party populated using
    default values.

    Each party has a unique `id`, which we refer to as the `signatory_id`.
    As with Documents, not all fields may be changed using the `update` call.

    For details of this data structure, please refer to `Signatory` in the
    [Definitions](#definitions).

    ## Callbacks
    The Scrive eSign system can trigger API callbacks when some significant
    property of a Document changes, as for example, when a signing party signs
    the Document.

    For callbacks to be triggered, you need to set the `api_callback_url` value
    on the Document.
    You can also trigger callbacks manually using the `callback` API call (this
    call has no effect if the `api_callback_url` is not set).

    For certain use cases it is possible to instead have a "User callback
    scheme" defined.
    You will need to contact us to set this up, and setting callbacks on
    Documents is the preferred solution.

    The Scrive eSign system will perform an `HTTP POST` request, with the
    following `POST` parameters:

    * `document_id`: As the name implies, the unique Document ID
    * `document_json`: The Document JSON, see [Definitions](#definitions)
    * `document_signed_and_sealed`: A boolean `true` or `false`, which indicates
      whether the document has been signed and sealed with a digital signature

    There will generally be two callbacks executed with
    `document_signed_and_sealed` set to `true`.
    The first will be shortly after all signing parties have signed the document
    and Scrive has applied a digital signature, and the second will be
    issued when a keyless signature has been applied to the document.
    This usually happens between 15-30 days after the original signing date.

    We guarantee to make *at least* one callback when the Document status
    changes to one of the following values:

    * `pending`
    * `closed`
    * `canceled`
    * `timedout`
    * `rejected`

    We cannot guarantee to make only one callback per status change, and we may
    trigger callbacks for changes not listed here.
    Furthermore, a callback does not indicate _what_ changed in a document, it
    simply tells you the current state of a document.
    Finally, callbacks will not be triggered for documents that have been
    deleted.

    The Scrive eSign system will look at the HTTP response code returned by the
    callback URL.
    If it is not an HTTP `2xx` response, then the callback will be retried in
    increasing intervals, the first after 5 minutes.
    After 10 failed attempts, we will no longer attempt the callback.

    We may modify the specifics of this behaviour without notice.

    # Authentication
    The Scrive Document API supports OAuth 1.0 and personal access credentials
    based on this.

    Where your application needs to perform actions on behalf of Users, the
    recommended approach is to use the full OAuth workflow.

    ## Personal Access Credentials
    > You can retrieve personal access credentials for a user account using a
    > special endpoint and supplying their login details.
    >
    > Using cURL, you can do:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'https://{server_address}/api/v2/getpersonaltoken' \
      --data-urlencode 'email={user_email}' \
      --data-urlencode 'password={user_password}'
    ```

    > Replacing `{server_address}`, `{user_email}` and `{user_password}` to
    > the appropriate values.
    >
    > Or, if you are using the `login_token` method:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'https://{server_address}/api/v2/getpersonaltoken' \
      --data-urlencode 'login_token={login_token}'
    ```

    > Replacing `{server_address}`, `{login_token}` to the appropriate values.
    >
    > These two methods will both return the personal access tokens as a JSON:

    ```json
    {
      "apitoken" : "987dfsd312sd76sh_123"
    , "apisecret" : "c47b87126dsacbhb"
    , "accesstoken" : "2d1287dassg22jke_114"
    , "accesssecret" : "12876adsdhght665"
    }
    ```

    > Then, given the following example personal access credentials:
    >
    > * Client credentials identifier:
    >   `apitoken = 123`
    > * Client credentials secret:

    Instead of OAuth, clients may access the Scrive API using personal access
    credentials.
    A user can create personal access credentials in the [Scrive Account
    Section](https://scrive.com/account#api-dashboard) through the web
    interface, or using a dedicated API call, as described in the right column.

    Only one personal token is available per user.
    Such credentials can be used instead of OAuth client and token credentials
    in API calls.
    The personal access credentials are associated with the user and can be
    used instead of any other OAuth privileges, they are intended for special
    cases where OAuth is not a viable option, or for getting started quickly in
    a sandbox environment.

    There are two ways to use this endpoint. One is to provide the username and
    password of the user you are creating the personal access credentials for.
    The other is to provide a `login_token`. These are temporary tokens created
    by the `gettokenforpersonalcredentials` endpoint. These are demonstrated in
    the sidebar.

    <aside class="warning">
    Storing personal access tokens outside of the Scrive eSign system is
    equivalent to storing a user password.

    Due to this, we do recommend using OAuth where possible.
    </aside>

    ## OAuth

    Managing API access is done through a Scrive user account, and each user
    account may have zero or more client credentials.
    These client credentials are managed in the [Integration settings
    tab](https://scrive.com/account#api-dashboard) of the user account
    settings.

    These client credentials may be used to request privileges from users.
    Users, in turn, can approve or deny granting such privileges.
    They may also remove privileges as they see fit, from the Integration
    settings tab.

    The OAuth authorisation sequence allows you to request privileges from a
    user and retrieve token credentials.
    Once these have been approved, you may use the token credentials to make
    API requests on behalf of the user.

    ### OAuth privileges
    The current API version accepts the following privileges names:
    `DOC_CREATE`, `DOC_CHECK`, and `DOC_SEND`.

    Permission levels required for each API call are described on a per call
    basis.

    ### OAuth and Cookies
    As the Scrive eSign web interface uses the Scrive API, all API calls
    support two modes of authentication: OAuth based, and browser cookie based.
    If the `Authorization` header is set, any browser cookies are ignored.

    ### OAuth 1.0 Workflow
    > ### OAuth Workflow using cURL
    > Here we provide some examples using the cURL command.
    >
    > **1. Temporary credentials request using cURL and response:**

    ```bash
    $ curl 'https://${host}/oauth/temporarycredentials?privileges=DOC_CREATE%2BDOC_SEND' \
      -H 'Authorization: oauth_realm="Scrive",oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT",oauth_consumer_key="4d224b89875b39af_2",oauth_signature="f446cae781995b05&aaaaaa",oauth_callback="http://www.mywebsite.com/scrive"'

    oauth_token=b0d6be3270a2b3ad_8&oauth_token_secret=dac0ec76e037c01d&oauth_callback_confirmed=true
    ```

    > **2. Now redirect the user to:**

    ```
    https://${host}/oauth/authorization?oauth_token=b0d6be3270a2b3ad_8
    ```

    > If the user grants access to your application, they will be redirected to:

    ```
    http://www.mywebsite.com/scrive?=&oauth_token=b0d6be3270a2b3ad_8&oauth_verifier=6382be3e8fcafd94
    ```

    > **3. You should now request for an OAuth token using all the information:**

    ```
    $ curl '${host}/oauth/tokencredentials' \
      -H 'Authorization: oauth_realm="Scrive",oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT",oauth_consumer_key="4d224b89875b39af_2",oauth_signature="f446cae781995b05&dac0ec76e037c01d",oauth_token="b0d6be3270a2b3ad_8",oauth_verifier="6382be3e8fcafd94"'

    oauth_token=0e870aa5ff434d5a_2&oauth_token_secret=22adb49346ba7674
    ```

    > You should now be able to perform an API call, for example:

    ```
    curl -X POST '${host}/api/v2/documents/new' \
      -H 'Authorization: oauth_realm="Scrive",oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT",oauth_consumer_key="4d224b89875b39af_2",oauth_signature="f446cae781995b05&22adb49346ba7674",oauth_token="0e870aa5ff434d5a_2"'
    ```

    The OAuth workflow consists of three steps, which we will describe in turn:

    1. Temporary credentials request and response
    2. Authorisation redirect
    3. Token request and response

    **1. Temporary Credentials**

    You must first request temporary credentials using the client credentials
    identifier and secret from your account’s [Integration settings
    tab](https://scrive.com/account#api-dashboard).

    To do so you must issue a `GET` request to
    `https://${host}/oauth/temporarycredentials?privileges=${privileges}` with
    the following parameters in the `authorization` header:

    * `oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT"`
    * `oauth_consumer_key="${consumer_key}"`
    * `oauth_signature="${consumer_secret}&aaaaaa"`
    * `oauth_callback="${oauth_callback_url}"`

    `${privileges}` must be separated by a `+`, for example
    `"DOC_CREATE+DOC_SEND"` (or `%2B` when URL encoded).
    You can set `${oauth_callback_url}` to what you like, but it must be set.
    The `oauth_signature` must be appended with a dummy `&aaaaaa` at this
    stage, it will be replaced with other tokens later.

    The reponse should include an `oauth_token`, `oauth_token_secret`, and
    `oauth_callback_confirmed=true`.

    **2. Authorisation redirect**

    You must now redirect the User to
    `https://${host}/oauth/authorization?oauth_token=${oauth_token}` using the
    `oauth_token` from the previous step.

    The user will be asked to grant you the requested privileges, displaying
    your company name.

    If they accept, they will be redirected to:

    * `${oauth_callback}?=&oauth_token=${oauth_token}&oauth_verifier=${oauth_verifier}`

    If they reject, the redirection will be to:

    * `${oauth_callback}?=&oauth_token=${oauth_token}&denied=true`

    Therefore, you should be able to inspect the redirection to the callback
    URL.

    **3. Token request**

    Now you should have the following pieces of information:

    * `oauth_consumer_key`
    * `oauth_token`
    * `oauth_verifier`

    We then use `oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT"` and construct a new
    `oauth_signature` from the client credentials secret and temporary
    credentials secret:

    * `oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT"`
    * `oauth_signature="${consumer_secret}&${oauth_token_secret}"`

    Finally, we wrap all of this into the `Authorization` header to
    `https://${host}/oauth/tokencredentials` and get back an `oauth_token` and
    `oauth_token_secret`.

    We can now make API calls on behalf of the User by including the finalised
    tokens in the `Authorization` header:

    * `oauth_consumer_key`
    * `oauth_token`
    * `oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT"`
    * `oauth_signature`

    # Errors

    > Error responses will contain a JSON response body, structured as follows:

    ```plaintext
    {
      "error_type": "$error_type$"
    , "error_message": "$error_message$"
    , "http_code": $http_code$
    }
    ```

    > For example:

    ```json
    {
      "error_type": "resource_not_found"
    , "error_message": "The resource was not found. A document with id $id$ was not found."
    , "http_code": 404
    }
    ```

    Scrive uses HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API
    request.

    HTTP response codes in the `2xx` range indicate that the API call completed
    successfully.
    The `4xx` range indicates an error, either due to missing, incomplete, or
    not applicable information (e.g. missing or invalid parameters, invalid
    authorisation, etc.).

    When a request is well formed, but does not satisfy necessary conditions,
    then we will return a `409` code.
    For example, when trying to start the signing process for a document that
    has already been signed.

    Codes in the `5xx` range suggest an error with Scrive’s eSign system, they
    could also indicate planned system downtime, and will be rare.

    The following table of error responses applies to all API calls, there may
    be additional errors which are specific to the respective API calls, but
    will follow the same structure.
