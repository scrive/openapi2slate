You may want to whitelist\nthese addresses in your firewalls for outgoing traffic but more importantly for incoming traffic from\nScrive eSign when using callbacks.\n\n<aside class=\"warning\">\nDo not call the API using these IP addresses directly! Server Name Identification (SNI) is used to\nroute calls to different services on the same IP address and thus hostnames must be used to reliably reach\nthe service you intend to integrate with.\n</aside>\n\n\n### Production\nThe main application is available through the `scrive.com` domain.\n\n<aside class=\"notice\">\nThis is the live production environment, for testing, please use API Testbed.\n</aside>\n\nThe IP addresses that may be used as endpoints to and from our system are:\n\n* 46.51.201.244\n* 52.208.49.53\n* 54.229.202.191\n* 54.246.132.30\n* 54.72.249.47\n* 54.72.251.235\n* 34.251.5.243\n* 52.208.131.2\n* 99.80.133.235\n\n### API Testbed\n\nA testing environment is available through the `api-testbed.scrive.com`\ndomain.\n\nThis environment should be used when developing an integration with the\nScrive eSign system.\n\n<aside class=\"warning\">\nThis is not to be used with any critical information.\nWe make no guarantees as to the availability of the server, or the data\nstored by it.\n</aside>\n\nWe usually deploy the latest production environment to our API testbed, but\nmay occasionally update it with newer builds, which may not be as reliable\nor well tested.\n\nThe API testbed uses `54.229.20.170` as its IP address.\n\n## API Explorer\nAn interactive API Explorer is available for both environments:\n\n* [API Testbed](https://api-testbed.scrive.com/api-explorer)\n* [Production](https://scrive.com/api-explorer)\n\nThis is useful way to test API calls and the OAuth workflow.\n\nThe implementation is in JavaScript and you can use\n[Firebug](https://getfirebug.com/) or the\n[Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) to inspect\nHTTP requests.\n\n## Upgrading from Version 1\nThere is no change to the Document workflow from Version 1 of the API.\nThe main changes in this version, compared to Version 1, are:\n\n* A new naming structure for API endpoints\n* Changes to the JSON data structures\n* Changes to parameters and their names\n* More comprehensive documentation\n* Better error messages\n\nThe root endpoint for Version 1 was `/api/v1`, this has changed to\n`/api/v2/documents`.\n\nMost of the parameters have had minor name changes to make it easier for\nnewcomers to use.\nHowever, the parameters for the `/list` call have undergone significant\nstructural changes.\n\n<aside class=\"notice\">\nThe most important things to watch for when upgrading from Version 1, apart\nfrom those listed above:\n</aside>\n\n* The Document JSON structure has changed, and fields have been renamed\n* The list call returns the full Document JSON for all documents, make sure\n  you include `gzip` in your `Accept-Encoding` header to avoid large\n  response sizes.\n\nThe following table summarises the changes in naming of the API calls.\nFor details of the new parameters and JSON data structures, please consult\nthe documentation.\n\n| API

Start\nTo get started using our API it is recommended to first read the\n[Introduction](#introduction), this will give you an overview of some key\nconcepts in use by the Scrive eSign system.\n\nOnce you are familiar with the basic concepts the simplest document workflow\ncan be achieved by:\n\n1. Creating a new document using `api/v2/documents/new`\n   (see [New Document](#new-document))\n2. Updating the document with the desired process options and signatory\n   details using `api/v2/documents/{document_id}/update`\n   (see [Update a document](#update-a-document))\n3. Start the signing process with `api/v2/documents/{document_id}/start`\n   (see [Start the signing process](#start-the-signing-process))\n\n# Introduction\nScrive eSign is a system for signing documents electronically.\n\nUsers need to create an account with Scrive to create and send Documents,\nbut recipients do not need to have an account.\n\nDocuments in the Scrive eSign system define the parties to the document,\nincluding the information these parties parties should fill out, the\ndocument workflow, such as delivery and authentication for the parties, and\nmany other features related to the E-signing of documents as provided by\nScrive.\n\nThe Scrive Document API uses the Document JSON data structure to represent\nDocuments in the Scrive eSign system.\nThese always include an array of `parties`, which are either signing or\nnon-signing parties to the document, and represent the workflow assigned to\nthat party, and their individual information.\nThese use the Signatory JSON data structure.\n\nWe will first talk about the Document JSON, followed by the Signatory JSON.\nFor the reference documentation about these data structures please see the\n[Definitions](#definitions).\n\n## Documents\nA core data structure used throughout the API is the Document JSON.\nThe Document JSON is used to create documents, define the workflow for\nsigning and non-signing parties, monitor the progress of the document, etc.\n\nA key property of a document is its `status` (as defined by\n[DocumentStatus](#document-status)).\n\nNewly created documents have `status: \"preparation\"` and can be easily\nmodified.\nMost changes to the Document at this stage are done using the Document\n`update` API call, by passing a Document JSON with values updated as\nnecessary.\nNot all fields can be updated in this way.\nFor example, the Document’s `id` is auto-generated and cannot be changed.\nFor details of which fields cannot be updated in this way, look for the\n`readOnly` property in the Document [Definitions](#definitions).\n\nOnce the document signing process has been started, using the `start` API\ncall, the `status` will change to `\"pending\"` and relatively few\nmodifications by the author are possible.\nMaking the `start` API call will also deliver the document to the parties,\ndepending on the delivery methods set (e.g. by email or SMS).\n\nAfter all signing parties have successfully signed the document, its status\nwill change to `\"closed\"`, after which it cannot be modified.\n\nA pending document can also be cancelled by the author using the `cancel`\nAPI call, or rejected by a signing party, resulting in its status being\n`\"cancelled\"` or `\"rejected\"`, respectively.\n\nAny actions performed by parties to a document,

refer to `Document` in the [Definitions](#definitions) for a\ndetailed description of all the fields available, and their use.\n\n## Templates\nIt is possible to set up template documents to be used with the \"new\ndocument from template\" API call.\n\nAny document in preparation can be made into a template by executing an\nupdate call and setting the `\"template\"` field to be `true`. This cannot be\nreversed once set, and templates cannot direclty be made into documents for\nsigning.\n\nTemplates have the same JSON structure as regular documents and can also be\nupdated.\nIn particular, their `\"id\"` can be used to\n[create a new document from a template](#new-document-from-template).\nUpdating a template will only affect documents created from a template\n*after* the template was updated.\n\nFinally, using the list call, it is possible to list all your available\ntemplates by setting the appropriate filters.\n\n## Parties\nEvery Document has an array field named `parties`.\nThis defines the signing and viewing parties to a document, their details,\nhow the document is to be delivered to them, an extra authentication that\nmust be performed, etc.\n\nIt is possible to add an extra party to a Document in preparation using the\n`update` call.\nSimply add an extra empty object (*i.e.* `{ }`) to the list of existing\nparties and the Scrive API will return an additional party populated using\ndefault values.\n\nEach party has a unique `id`, which we refer to as the `signatory_id`.\nAs with Documents, not all fields may be changed using the `update` call.\n\nFor details of this data structure, please refer to `Signatory` in the\n[Definitions](#definitions).\n\n## Callbacks\nThe Scrive eSign system can trigger API callbacks when some significant\nproperty of a Document changes, as for example, when a signing party signs\nthe Document.\n\nFor callbacks to be triggered, you need to set the `api_callback_url` value\non the Document.\nYou can also trigger callbacks manually using the `callback` API call (this\ncall has no effect if the `api_callback_url` is not set).\n\nFor certain use cases it is possible to instead have a \"User callback\nscheme\" defined.\nYou will need to contact us to set this up, and setting callbacks on\nDocuments is the preferred solution.\n\nThe Scrive eSign system will perform an `HTTP POST` request, with the\nfollowing `POST` parameters:\n\n* `document_id`: As the name implies, the unique Document ID\n* `document_json`: The Document JSON, see [Definitions](#definitions)\n* `document_signed_and_sealed`: A boolean `true` or `false`, which indicates\n  whether the document has been signed and sealed with a digital signature\n\nThere will generally be two callbacks executed with\n`document_signed_and_sealed` set to `true`.\nThe first will be shortly after all signing parties have signed the document\nand Scrive has applied a digital signature, and the second will be\nissued when a keyless signature has been applied to the document.\nThis usually happens between 15-30 days after the original signing date.\n\nWe guarantee to make *at least* one callback when the Document status\nchanges to one of the following values:\n\n* `pending`\n* `closed`\n* `canceled`\n* `timedout`\n* `rejected`\n\nWe cannot guarantee to make only one callback per status change, and we may\ntrigger callbacks for changes not listed here.\nFurthermore, a callback does not indicate _what_ changed in a document, it\nsimply tells you the current state of a document.\nFinally, callbacks will not be triggered for documents that have been\ndeleted.\n\nThe Scrive eSign system will look at the HTTP response code returned by the\ncallback URL.\nIf it is not an HTTP `2xx` response, then the callback will be retried in\nincreasing intervals, the first after 5 minutes.\nAfter 10 failed attempts, we will no longer attempt the callback.\n\nWe may modify the specifics of this behaviour without notice.\n\n# Authentication\nThe Scrive Document API supports OAuth 1.0 and personal access credentials\nbased on this.\n\nWhere your application needs to perform actions on behalf of Users, the\nrecommended approach is to use the full OAuth workflow.\n\n## Personal Access Credentials\n> You can retrieve personal access credentials for a user account using a\n> special endpoint and supplying their login details.\n>\n> Using cURL, you can do:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'https://{server_address}/api/v2/getpersonaltoken' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'email={user_email}' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'password={user_password}'\n```\n\n> Replacing `{server_address}`, `{user_email}` and `{user_password}` to\n> the appropriate values.\n>\n> Or, if you are using the `login_token` method:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'https://{server_address}/api/v2/getpersonaltoken' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'login_token={login_token}'\n```\n\n> Replacing `{server_address}`, `{login_token}` to the appropriate values.\n>\n> These two methods will both return the personal access tokens as a JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"apitoken\" : \"987dfsd312sd76sh_123\"\n, \"apisecret\" : \"c47b87126dsacbhb\"\n, \"accesstoken\" : \"2d1287dassg22jke_114\"\n, \"accesssecret\" : \"12876adsdhght665\"\n}\n```\n\n> Then, given the following example personal access credentials:\n>\n> * Client credentials identifier:\n>   `apitoken = 123`\n> * Client credentials secret:\n>   `apisecret = abc`\n> * Token credentials identifier:\n>   `accesstoken = 456`\n> * Token credentials secret:\n>   `accesssecret = cde`\n>\n> The following authorisation header can be used:\n>\n> `Authorization: oauth_signature_method=\"PLAINTEXT\", oauth_consumer_key=\"123\", oauth_token=\"456\",  oauth_signature=\"abc&cde\"`\n\nInstead of OAuth, clients may access the Scrive API using personal access\ncredentials.\nA user can create personal access credentials in the [Scrive Account\nSection](https://scrive.com/account#api-dashboard) through the web\ninterface, or using a dedicated API call, as described in the right column.\n\nOnly one personal token is available per user.\nSuch credentials can be used instead of OAuth client and token credentials\nin API calls.\nThe personal access credentials are associated with the user and can be\nused instead of any other OAuth privileges, they are intended for special\ncases where OAuth is not a viable option, or for getting started quickly in\na sandbox environment.\n\nThere are two ways to use this endpoint. One is to provide the username and\npassword of the user you are creating the personal access credentials for.\nThe other is to provide a `login_token`. These are temporary tokens created\nby the `gettokenforpersonalcredentials` endpoint. These are demonstrated in\nthe sidebar.\n\n<aside class=\"warning\">\nStoring personal access tokens outside of the Scrive eSign system is\nequivalent to storing a user password.\n\nDue to this, we do recommend using OAuth where possible.\n</aside>\n\n## OAuth\n\nManaging API access is done through a Scrive user account, and each user\naccount may have zero or more client credentials.\nThese client credentials are managed in the [Integration settings\ntab](https://scrive.com/account#api-dashboard) of the user account\nsettings.\n\nThese client credentials may be used to request privileges from users.\nUsers, in turn, can approve or deny granting such privileges.\nThey may also remove privileges as they see fit, from the Integration\nsettings tab.\n\nThe OAuth authorisation sequence allows you to request privileges from a\nuser and retrieve token credentials.\nOnce these have been approved, you may use the token credentials to make\nAPI requests on behalf of the user.\n\n### OAuth privileges\nThe current API version accepts the following privileges names:\n`DOC_CREATE`, `DOC_CHECK`, and `DOC_SEND`.\n\nPermission levels required for each API call are described on a per call\nbasis.\n\n### OAuth and Cookies\nAs the Scrive eSign web interface uses the Scrive API, all API calls\nsupport two modes of authentication: OAuth based, and browser cookie based.\nIf the `Authorization` header is set, any browser cookies are ignored.\n\n### OAuth 1.0 Workflow\n> ### OAuth Workflow using cURL\n> Here we provide some examples using the cURL command.\n>\n> **1. Temporary credentials request using cURL and response:**\n\n```bash\n$ curl 'https://${host}/oauth/temporarycredentials?privileges=DOC_CREATE%2BDOC_SEND' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: oauth_realm=\"Scrive\",oauth_signature_method=\"PLAINTEXT\",oauth_consumer_key=\"4d224b89875b39af_2\",oauth_signature=\"f446cae781995b05&aaaaaa\",oauth_callback=\"http://www.mywebsite.com/scrive\"'\n\noauth_token=b0d6be3270a2b3ad_8&oauth_token_secret=dac0ec76e037c01d&oauth_callback_confirmed=true\n```\n\n> **2. Now redirect the user to:**\n\n```\nhttps://${host}/oauth/authorization?oauth_token=b0d6be3270a2b3ad_8\n```\n\n> If the user grants access to your application, they will be redirected to:\n\n```\nhttp://www.mywebsite.com/scrive?=&oauth_token=b0d6be3270a2b3ad_8&oauth_verifier=6382be3e8fcafd94\n```\n\n> **3. You should now request for an OAuth token using all the information:**\n\n```\n$ curl '${host}/oauth/tokencredentials' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: oauth_realm=\"Scrive\",oauth_signature_method=\"PLAINTEXT\",oauth_consumer_key=\"4d224b89875b39af_2\",oauth_signature=\"f446cae781995b05&dac0ec76e037c01d\",oauth_token=\"b0d6be3270a2b3ad_8\",oauth_verifier=\"6382be3e8fcafd94\"'\n\noauth_token=0e870aa5ff434d5a_2&oauth_token_secret=22adb49346ba7674\n```\n\n> You should now be able to perform an API call, for example:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST '${host}/api/v2/documents/new' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: oauth_realm=\"Scrive\",oauth_signature_method=\"PLAINTEXT\",oauth_consumer_key=\"4d224b89875b39af_2\",oauth_signature=\"f446cae781995b05&22adb49346ba7674\",oauth_token=\"0e870aa5ff434d5a_2\"'\n```\n\nThe OAuth workflow consists of three steps, which we will describe in turn:\n\n1. Temporary credentials request and response\n2. Authorisation redirect\n3. Token request and response\n\n**1. Temporary Credentials**\n\nYou must first request temporary credentials using the client credentials\nidentifier and secret from your account’s [Integration settings\ntab](https://scrive.com/account#api-dashboard).\n\nTo do so you must issue a `GET` request to\n`https://${host}/oauth/temporarycredentials?privileges=${privileges}` with\nthe following parameters in the `authorization` header:\n\n* `oauth_signature_method=\"PLAINTEXT\"`\n* `oauth_consumer_key=\"${consumer_key}\"`\n* `oauth_signature=\"${consumer_secret}&aaaaaa\"`\n* `oauth_callback=\"${oauth_callback_url}\"`\n\n`${privileges}` must be separated by a `+`, for example\n`\"DOC_CREATE+DOC_SEND\"` (or `%2B` when URL encoded).\nYou can set `${oauth_callback_url}` to what you like, but it must be set.\nThe `oauth_signature` must be appended with a dummy `&aaaaaa` at this\nstage, it will be replaced with other tokens later.\n\nThe reponse should include an `oauth_token`, `oauth_token_secret`, and\n`oauth_callback_confirmed=true`.\n\n**2. Authorisation redirect**\n\nYou must now redirect the User to\n`https://${host}/oauth/authorization?oauth_token=${oauth_token}` using the\n`oauth_token` from the previous step.\n\nThe user will be asked to grant you the requested privileges, displaying\nyour company name.\n\nIf they accept, they will be redirected to:\n\n* `${oauth_callback}?=&oauth_token=${oauth_token}&oauth_verifier=${oauth_verifier}`\n\nIf they reject, the redirection will be to:\n\n* `${oauth_callback}?=&oauth_token=${oauth_token}&denied=true`\n\nTherefore, you should be able to inspect the redirection to the callback\nURL.\n\n**3. Token request**\n\nNow you should have the following pieces of information:\n\n* `oauth_consumer_key`\n* `oauth_token`\n* `oauth_verifier`\n\nWe then use `oauth_signature_method=\"PLAINTEXT\"` and construct a new\n`oauth_signature` from the client credentials secret and temporary\ncredentials secret:\n\n* `oauth_signature_method=\"PLAINTEXT\"`\n* `oauth_signature=\"${consumer_secret}&${oauth_token_secret}\"`\n\nFinally, we wrap all of this into the `Authorization` header to\n`https://${host}/oauth/tokencredentials` and get back an `oauth_token` and\n`oauth_token_secret`.\n\nWe can now make API calls on behalf of the User by including the finalised\ntokens in the `Authorization` header:\n\n* `oauth_consumer_key`\n* `oauth_token`\n* `oauth_signature_method=\"PLAINTEXT\"`\n* `oauth_signature`\n\n# Errors\n\n> Error responses will contain a JSON response body, structured as follows:\n\n```plaintext\n{\n  \"error_type\": \"$error_type$\"\n, \"error_message\": \"$error_message$\"\n, \"http_code\": $http_code$\n}\n```\n\n> For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error_type\": \"resource_not_found\"\n, \"error_message\": \"The resource was not found. A document with id $id$ was not found.\"\n, \"http_code\": 404\n}\n```\n\nScrive uses HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API\nrequest.\n\nHTTP response codes in the `2xx` range indicate that the API call completed\nsuccessfully.\nThe `4xx` range indicates an error, either due to missing, incomplete, or\nnot applicable information (e.g. missing or invalid parameters, invalid\nauthorisation, etc.).\n\nWhen a request is well formed, but does not satisfy necessary conditions,\nthen we will return a `409` code.\nFor example, when trying to start the signing process for a document that\nhas already been signed.\n\nCodes in the `5xx` range suggest an error with Scrive’s eSign system, they\ncould also indicate planned system downtime, and will be rare.\n\nThe following table of error responses applies to all API calls, there may\nbe additional errors which are specific to the respective API calls, but\nwill follow the same structure.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n

At time of writing, those extra\nobjects are `contact_details` and `settings`.\n\nThese dependent objects can be inherited. In this case, their\n`inherited_from` field will be non-null. The value in this field is the\nID of the User Group which the value is inherited from.\n\nInheritance works as follows:\n\nRoot User Groups (i.e. those who are not children of other User Groups) may\nnot inherit since there are no ancestors to inherit from.\n\nA child User Group may inherit or have its own dedicated object. In the case\nthat a User Group chooses to inherit, for example, the `contact_details`\nobject, then that User Group will inherit from the closest direct ancestor\nwith its own `contact_details` object.
